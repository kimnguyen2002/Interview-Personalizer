 ### Why use this tool?
- **Completely personalized**: Questions are selected based on keywords extracted from your CV.
- **Balanced and fair**: Helps candidates showcase their strengths while avoiding irrelevant or biased questions.

### Please note:
This tool is more well-suited for **software engineer** roles because it is based on the [Software Questions dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedmharis/software-engineering-interview-questions-dataset). But it could be well used for other technical roles.
